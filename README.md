# Personal Finance Management System

This is a simple Personal Finance Management System web application built with PHP and MySQL. It allows users to manage their income, expenses, and budgets to keep track of their financial activities.

## Features

- User Registration and Login: Users can register for a new account and log in to the system using their credentials.

- Dashboard: After logging in, users are presented with a dashboard that displays a summary of their total income, total expenditure, and net savings.

- Capture Income: Users can enter details of their income, including the source, amount, date, and narration.

- Capture Expenditure: Users can record their expenses, providing details such as the date, particulars, amount spent, and category.

- Capture Budget: Users can set up a budget by specifying a description and the budgeted amount for each category.

- Reports: Users can view reports that display their income, expenditure, and budget analysis. The reports are presented using Google Charts for visualization.

- Logout: Users can log out from their account to end the session.

## Requirements

- Web server with PHP support (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
- MySQL database
- PHP 5.6 or higher
- PDO extension for PHP
- Google Charts library (included via CDN)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local web server directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JacksVault/learn-php-main.git
```

2. Import the database schema and sample data using the `pfund_db.sql` file provided in the project's root directory:

```bash
mysql -u your-mysql-username -p pfund_db < pfund_db.sql
```

3. Configure the database connection settings by updating the `config.php` file:

```php
<?php
// Replace the following values with your actual database credentials
$host = 'localhost';
$db_name = 'pfund_db';
$db_user = 'your-mysql-username';
$db_password = 'your-mysql-password';

// Create a PDO database connection
try {
    $db_conn = new PDO("mysql:host={$host};dbname={$db_name}", $db_user, $db_password);
    $db_conn->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
} catch (PDOException $e) {
    die("Error: " . $e->getMessage());
}
?>
```

4. Ensure that PHP has read and write access to the project directory and the database.

5. Launch the application by accessing it through your web browser, e.g., `http://localhost/personal-finance-management/`.
